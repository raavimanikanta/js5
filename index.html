    <h1>Types of Variables in js </h1>
    <h3>Var,let,const</h3>
    <pre>
        Var is functional as well as global scope 
        It can redeclared and initialised 
        var can be modified later

        Let is a Block scope 
        redeclaration and reinitialization is not possible 
        let can be modified later

        const is a Block scope
        redeclaration and reinitialization is not possible 
        let cannot  be modified later

    <h1>Execution-context</h1>
    <pre>
       <h3>Execution-context  is divided into two parts</h3> 
       1.Memory creation phase
       2.Code Execution phase 
       <h3>Memory creation phase:</h3>
       In this phase the variables and functions are stored as key and value pairs .
       And memory will be allocated to the variables but it will be undefined .
       <h3>Code Execution phase</h3>
       In this phase the code gets executed line by line the memory gets allocated to the variables 
       the undefined gets turned to the particular value .If any functions exits in the code then new execution 
       context will be created .In this way the execution continues and after the entire code gets executed the 
       execution context gets deleted from the call stack.
